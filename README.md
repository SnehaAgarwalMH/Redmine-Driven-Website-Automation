Automate website actions based on Redmine data using Java and Selenium.

# Redmine-Driven Website Automation

Welcome to the "Redmine-Driven Website Automation" repository! This project enables you to automate website actions by reading data from Redmine issues. With the help of Java, Selenium, and other technologies, you can seamlessly interact with websites, perform actions, and capture dataâ€”all driven by the content of your Redmine issues.

## Project Overview

- **Data-Driven Automation**: Say goodbye to manual website interactions. This project reads data from Redmine issues and uses it to navigate websites, enter information, click buttons, and perform various actions.

- **Scheduled Actions**: Set up actions to run based on the data and schedule defined in your Redmine issues. This allows for precise timing and automation of repetitive tasks.

- **Screen Capture**: Capture screenshots during the automation process to document the state of the websites at different stages.

## Technology Stack

This project leverages a robust technology stack:

- **Java**: The core programming language for scripting and automation, ensuring stability and reliability.

- **Selenium WebDriver**: The trusted tool for automating web browsers, enabling seamless interaction with web pages.

- **Redmine Data**: Data is sourced from Redmine issues, allowing for easy management and customization of automation tasks.

## Getting Started

Ready to automate your website tasks using Redmine data? Here's what you need to do:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Java, Selenium WebDriver, and any required libraries for working with Redmine.

2. **Redmine Configuration**: Organize your data in Redmine issues according to the actions you want to automate. Make sure to specify URLs, actions, and any input parameters.

3. **Execution**: Run the main script, which will read the Redmine data and initiate the automation process based on your specifications.

4. **Screen Capture**: Screenshots are automatically saved during the automation process, providing a visual record of your actions.
