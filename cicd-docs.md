# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). The CI/CD process automates testing and deployment tasks when code changes are pushed to the repository.

## Workflows
- `redmine_automation.yaml`: Defines the workflow for automating website actions based on Redmine data.

## Configuration
The workflow is configured with specific steps to execute the automation script and upload artifacts. Customize the workflow as needed for your project.

## Usage
To use the CI/CD workflow, ensure that your repository contains the necessary automation script and dependencies. GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow based on the schedule defined in the YAML file.

## Documentation
For detailed information on setting up and customizing CI/CD workflows, refer to the [CI/CD Documentation](/docs/cicd-docs.md).

For details on using the Redmine-driven automation script, check the [Automation Documentation](/docs/automation-docs.md).
